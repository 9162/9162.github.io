<p>The “OHANA”, that is located relatively close to the last pier of sightseeing boat, Donko-bune, is designated as a national scenic spot and a national cultural asset, and all of its premises is recognized as the “Garden of Tachibana clan”. Inside of the Garden can be found a Japanese-style restaurant that serves “Unagi no Seiro-Mushi (eel steamed in a bamboo steamer)” a famous Yanagawa dish, as well as delicacies from the sea of Ariake and seasonal Kaiseki (multi course meal) with full of ideaa and amazing techniques, including a restaurant where casual diners with a large group and family are welcome. The taste of the Japanese-Style restaurant is highly appreciated by the guests that stay in the hotel located in the premise.</p>
