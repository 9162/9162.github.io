Abstract :</strong> 

 

In this paper the feasibility of using passive microwave
data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) satellite
sensor to retrieve information on the snow water equivalent
(SWE), representing the mass per unit area of water contained
within a snowpack, is investigated for an area of central Siberia.
A modelling chain combining a dynamic model of a snowpack
and a model of the brightness temperature obtained from a
passive microwave sensor such as SSM/I was used to generate
predictions of the difference in brightness temperature between
19 and 37 GHz for mid-Siberia, and these results compared to the
actual SSM/I data.
