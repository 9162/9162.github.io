<br/>
<br/>
Consider the following lemma: let  be a triangle and let  be a point on the side  such that . Then the following inequality takes place: 
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If  let us consider the point  on the segment  such that . 
<br/>
We have  and thus , because  is the largest side the triangle . 
<br/>
But , so we are done. 
<br/>
<br/>
If  we have  and thus , because  is the largest side the triangle . 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Back to the problem, we notice that at least two of the angles  , ,  are larger than . Indeed, if  two of them are less than , since their sum is , one of them would be larger than  which is an obvious contradiction. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, let us suppose WLOG that  and . Also consider . We apply the lemma for the triangles  and  and we obtain 
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
From (1) and (2), by addition, we obtain 
<br/>
 which solves our problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
Also there is the official solution, much complicated which I will post later.</p></span><hr/></div></body>
