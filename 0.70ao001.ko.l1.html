<dd>Can't say,  I cannot say<br/>
That deep down inside I don't mind if you die now<br/>
Can't say,  I cannot say<br/>
That way you'll have me forever<br/>
I cannot say<br/>
<br/>
Can't say,  I cannot say<br/>
There's no better way to keep you in my mind<br/>
Can't say, I cannot say<br/>
Cause I know your lips probably won't mind <br/>
<br/>
Sneaky? Am I?  The world is full of contraries<br/>
<br/>
Ah, in the world without you I'll finally be who you want me to be<br/>
Ah, you hate lies, here's the world perfect for you<br/>
<br/>
Can't say, I cannot say<br/>
To you it's weakness but to me it's a fine mechanism of love<br/>
<br/>
Can't say, I cannot say<br/>
Don't wanna hear passion die I would rather…<br/>
Can't say, I cannot say<br/>
What comes next, though I felt it coming from a while ago<br/>
Still, the way your face move is scary that I<br/>
Can't say, I cannot say<br/>
Either way, for sure, I will break you one day<br/>
<br/>
Surround us with thick rule no one can step into<br/>
<br/>
If you cry, if you laugh, it will collapse<br/>
What a thought, what a joke<br/>
<br/>
Don't bother, they don't understand, our love will come around with our consent<br/>
Love is always desperate, love is not weak<br/>
Weak is the dream that love sometimes shows<br/>
<br/>
Can't say, I cannot say<br/>
That deep down inside I don't mind if you die now<br/>
Can't say,  I cannot say<br/>
I's because I want to continue to live inside<br/>
That little heart of yours<br/>
<br/>
Can't see, I cannot see<br/>
Can't erase, I cannot erase<br/>
<br/>
Ah, in the world without you I finally won't get lost<br/>
Ah, you hate lies, the world which disappointed you will end today<br/>
“Ah, you are not here” woes the world, I don't give a damn<br/>
<br/>
“Good night”</dd>

<dd>Live coverage, we're on the air,  thanks for waiting guys<br/>
Are we on?  Yea yea we are  Hello again<br/>
I wanna start by introducing my fellow commentator, Mr. God<br/>
At age 2011, he's the world creator, a great mentor<br/>
A smug look  Hail yeah!  Thanks for everything  You fed us well<br/>
Oh I almost forgot, I am yours truly, Budda<br/>
<br/>
Today in our Game of Life, we feature an island in Asia, Japan<br/>
Don't miss it cause we are really excited<br/>
Let's start by taking a good look at how these fellas live down there<br/>
Oh wait, something weird is happening…<br/>
<br/>
Oh my!  With a rope in his hand he was about to hang himself <br/>
But isn't he shaking?  Is he feeling unsure? Isn't it too late?<br/>
<br/>
OK, Camera 3, get up close to his face<br/>
His heartbeat is up, can barely hear but listen to what he has to say<br/>
<br/>
“I can't stand it, can't no more, not for a second<br/>
What I need is not oxygen, it's not here, not anywhere<br/>
<br/>
You die you lose, so what? shut up, don't care to win, you asshole<br/>
Don't talk about the courage to die, blah-blah-blah<br/>
<br/>
Nothing scares me now, I'm almighty<br/>
Why talk all that shit?<br/>
If you wanna tease me you've made your point<br/>
People just love themselves from head to toe<br/>
<br/>
I hate myself again, I try hard to see<br/>
Hanging on, I'm alone again<br/>
I prayed but it was more than I thought…”<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, we just lost our audio<br/>
<br/>
Our commentary booth is behind the galaxy net <br/>
High above their head beyond the sky beyond the space and time<br/>
Sit back and enjoy, we're so much higher than where they are <br/>
Let's be thankful that their planet isn't ours<br/>
<br/>
My my, oh no, holy moly<br/>
Look how far they've come, a million years of dumbness<br/>
Producing massive spent fuel waste, piles of dirt<br/>
Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear to say the least<br/>
Deforms and facsinoma, you can't help but hate even your own child<br/>
What a freak, my boy, like garbage, where shall I begin cutting off?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. God, would you give us a word?<br/>
To us who's “smart enough to not die but dumb enough to not survive”<br/>
<br/>
We know who we are <br/>
Why talk all that shit?<br/>
If you wanna tease me you've made your point<br/>
People just love themselves from head to toe<br/>
<br/>
I hate myself again, I try hard to see<br/>
Hanging on, I'm alone again<br/>
I prayed but it was more than I thought<br/>
People just love “ME” like obesity<br/>
<br/>
We've watched this Game of Life over the last two thousand years<br/>
Can't believe there's no sign of progress<br/>
<br/>
Another flop, my friend,  I'll call it a wrap<br/>
There's no choice, helpless, incurable, not worth talking<br/>
<br/>
Oh look!  There's someone in her knees praying like hell<br/>
“Oh please Mr. God, Mr. God, Mr. Buddha.  Please make my wish come true”<br/>
<br/>
God “So what will we do?”<br/>
Bud “Wait”<br/>
God “Let's make it happen”<br/>
Bud “Wait, I said”<br/>
<br/>
God “Stay out of it.  It's none of your business”<br/>
Bud “It is my business”<br/>
God “Why?  She said Oh please Mr. God”<br/>
Bud “She said Mr. Buddha, too.  Didn't you hear?”<br/>
<br/>
God “Just once.  I was called twice”<br/>
Bud “Nonsense”<br/><br/>
God “I see.  She's your type, right?”
<br/>
Bud “F—k off! You wanna do it?”<br/>
God “Hell yeah!  Come, all my followers!  Come and meet!<br/>
        Let them see the power of God!”<br/>
Bud “Eat this!  The rage of Buddha!” <br/>
<br/>
We know it's all wrong<br/>
Why talk all that shit?<br/>
If you wanna tease me you've made your point <br/>
People just love themselves from head to toe<br/>
<br/>
I hate myself again, I try hard to see<br/>
Hanging on, I'm alone again<br/>
I prayed but it was more than I thought<br/>
People just love “ME” like obesity</dd>

<dd>Oh how I wish the rain that got me a cold yesterday<br/>
Washed down someone else's tears, in a strange karma<br/>
<br/>
Anything and everything I'm OK on my own,  I get all the rewards<br/>
Do you need a receipt?<br/>
No you don't, yes, come here and sit<br/>
How dare you make such a remark<br/>
Who's to say who owes what from where to where<br/>
<br/>
This world is a overflow with nameless things, tag-less treasures<br/>
In a dignified karma it'll all come around<br/>
Confession of a lifetime, youth spent worth a lifetime<br/>
I know what saved me was the stars at night and a brief rain<br/>
<br/>
It's gotta be, anything and everything<br/>
<br/>
If the world is to end tomorrow<br/>
I'll plant an apple tree today, someone says<br/>
Then I'll say, I'll write down everything about this world<br/>
Make it in time for the new world starting day after tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Dear all who will live our next world<br/>
Let me tell you about our virtues and flaws<br/>
Our next world should never end<br/>
Please don't break our precious chains<br/>
<br/>
Oh how I wish suppressed anger in the voices<br/>
Would add up to feed and nurture love<br/>
<br/>
To what the blue sky demands from us in return<br/>
There is nothing we can do, no matter how, like it or not<br/>
If I try to repay my debt to all people and things<br/>
That made me who I am, it'll take my lifetime<br/>
<br/>
Then I'll plant the seeds given and make them bloom<br/>
I'd rather take the risk, what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
You think there's nothing wrong with that, right?  then why?<br/>
It's not for your eyes to see, won't taste a thing<br/>
Secretly stealing, depriving, exaggerating, disgusted, envy<br/>
Do you live to repeat? Or repeat to live?<br/>
Sad story, who's going to stop your tears from falling down?<br/>
<br/>
Let me plug you eyes<br/>
<br/>
If the world is to end tomorrow<br/>
I'll plant an apple tree today, someone says<br/>
Then I'll say, I'll write down everything about this world<br/>
Make it in time for the new world starting day after tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Dear all who will live our next world<br/>
Let me tell you all about our virtues and flaws<br/>
Our next world should never end<br/>
Please don't break our precious chains<br/>
<br/>
If a baby were born on the day before the world ends<br/>
Still I'll name that child<br/>
<br/>
Smiling baby clad in future<br/>
I'll talk to the child until the last moment<br/>
<br/>
If the world is to end tomorrow<br/>
I'll plant an apple tree today, someone says<br/>
Then I'll bottle a song and throw into the sea<br/>
About the new world starting day after tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Dear all who will live our next world<br/>
Let me tell you all about our virtues and flaws<br/>
Our next world should never end<br/>
Please don't break our precious chains<br/>
Please don't terminate tomorrow, don't multiply zero</dd>

<dd>What's true friendship?  I don' know<br/>
But if this isn't, I don't need it, don't care <br/>
<br/>
So this is youth?  No idea<br/>
But if this isn't, I don't need it, don't care to know<br/>
<br/>
Can't even remember how we met, we were so careless<br/>
If whimsical wind blows we'll blow apart<br/>
<br/>
Never good at getting along, I was hesitant<br/>
Then why and how did we come this far?<br/>
<br/>
I guess we looked at things the same way<br/>
What felt good and made us happy,  indescribable soft spots we shared<br/>
<br/>
Like miracle it was one of the best things<br/>
That could have ever happened to me - YOU<br/>
<br/>
What's true friendship?  I don' know<br/>
But if this isn't, I don't need it, don't care<br/>
<br/>
So this is youth?  No idea<br/>
But if this isn't, I don't need it, don't care to know<br/>
<br/>
Never said “We're friends”, took it for granted<br/>
Too shy to admit but now's the chance to say<br/>
<br/>
Get drunk, get bruises all over our bodies, no sense no more<br/>
Binge drinking, whiplash next morning, what are we gonna do today?<br/> 
At 5 a.m. in the morning<br/>
<br/>
Brazen shameless hoochie coochie, a damn good music playing in the background<br/>
On the night I vowed to be alone, wait, it will break soon<br/>
<br/>
Don't wanna comply, bark, or settle, I'm always astray but never waver<br/>
Sometimes I take their hands, let them decide, can't even say thank you<br/>
<br/>
Broken dream shattered into pieces<br/>
It wasn't a silly dream,  we believed in it<br/>
I know I saw you from the front row, watching how brave you acted<br/>
<br/>
You were more beautiful than you ever were<br/>
You were more brave than any time in your life<br/>
I was envious of the dream we shared<br/>
Although my part was one in a few billionth<br/>
For the first time in my life I learned to dream someone else's dream<br/>
<br/>
What's true friendship?  I don' know<br/>
But if this isn't, I don't need it, don't care<br/>
<br/>
So this is youth?  No idea<br/>
But if this isn't, I don't need it, don't care to know<br/>
<br/>
I used to cling onto what I thought mattered<br/>
Refusing to let go, clenched my fist tight<br/>
<br/>
But I've changed, that's all gone<br/>
I can show you, I can tell you, this is who I am<br/>
<br/>
By tomorrow our bond may disappear<br/>
Good enough for us than to hope it's forever<br/>
<br/>
It'll be gone one day, it's a wink and a blink away<br/>
Ephemeral pleasure, what a gas, don't care, I'll take you into mine</dd>

<dd>So which side am I on today?   The world is all to blame<br/>
Babble in victims heaven or be an assailant in an apologizing contest?<br/>
<br/>
The correct answer is the former!  Got anything to offer?<br/>
I can easily walk pass the world's unhappiest victim<br/>
A moving story, tears running down, a blockbuster of all time<br/>
Congrats, you guys, but whose tear are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
How much longer do I have to talk to a scumbag<br/>
Until I can believe the tears of someone I hardly know?<br/>
That's my preposition, so I wake up again<br/>
But this swimming pool almost made me puke<br/>
<br/>
So gross<br/>
<br/>
Your love and my stubbornness, can both survive tomorrow?<br/>
One that survives the afternoon of the Judgement Day is a winner<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind if you hate me<br/>
But it hurts to see a puppy bark at me<br/>
Flee from insomnia, corpse, pressure, poverty, boredom and anticipation<br/>
This world is the reverse replay of Red Light Green Light<br/>
<br/>
Who did what and when, what's wrong, whatsoever<br/>
No matter how much you act like you care<br/>
Whatever you do, all you do is to feed<br/>
Your appetite<br/>
<br/>
So amazing<br/>
<br/>
Your but's and my though's, can both survive tomorrow?<br/>
Just for once I want to show my 100% pure self-sacrifice<br/>
<br/>
Your love and my stubbornness, can both survive tomorrow?<br/>
One that survives the afternoon of the Judgement Day is a winner<br/>
<br/>
When push comes to shove, victim is the ultimate winner<br/>
Consolation game, 3-seconds to self destruction, it's me who laughs last</dd>

<dd>I won't forgive you, no matter what, I won't<br/>
If you were attacked, ripped your clothes off, raped and dumped like trash<br/>
I'll skip past you with a big smile humming<br/>
I won't forgive you, never forgive you, never ever<br/>
<br/>
There's not a single trace of grief or sorrow<br/>
Spoiled child, what a pretty face, what an ugly rotten face<br/>
I want to poke you with a fork<br/>
Ah I want to see you dead, I want to see your dead body<br/>
<br/>
Ashamed of my ugliness, I hang my head low<br/>
Said I'm sorry before I say my name<br/>
Lived all my life as humble as I can<br/>
What an idiot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I see you I realize I'm the world's most innocent being<br/>
But there's no need for you to be there, and to make sure that I can be kind to myself<br/> 
I don't need you<br/>
<br/>
I won't forgive you, no matter what, I won't<br/>
If you ask for help, stabbed by a random attacker, organs ruptured, splitting blood<br/>
I'll jump rope with that ruptured organ listening to my favorite song on headphones<br/>
I won't forgive you, never forgive you, never ever<br/>
<br/>
How unfair is this world that there's no law to bring justice to your sin<br/>
So I will punish you. NOT, Just kidding you idiot<br/>
<br/>
May all the words I said to you R.I.P.<br/>
I want my beloved semen I've release in your body back, please<br/>
Pitiful pitiful I could cry<br/>
<br/>
I hate you like the sky so blue, like falling flower pedals, it's self-explanatory<br/>
I am, in the movie you play the lead, the mightiest and the worst villain<br/>
After turmoil we have reached, I found myself an absolute being<br/>
This is how people continues to live, right?  You are my first religion<br/>
<br/>
I won't forgive you, no matter what<br/>
When your child is old enough to say<br/>
“Mom, why did you have me?”<br/>
“I wish I weren't your child.”<br/>
“I wish I weren't your child.”<br/>
“I wish I weren't your child.”<br/>
<br/>
Then, I'll come strutting, hold her gently in my arms and say<br/>
You haven't done anything wrong, it's not your fault, not your fault</dd>

<dd>Let's talk about everyday things I don't get to hear these days<br/>
Enough about how long till the world ends, tell me what you ate last night<br/>
<br/>
You live in the distance,  job well done<br/>
Use not just head and right hand, but sometimes your hips<br/>
<br/>
A cracking voice of an old man says “Young people nowadays!”<br/>
From centuries ago they've always been like that<br/>
<br/>
What is normal?  Where can you find it?  Looking desperate and plausible<br/>
Hate to say but it's right there, it's the world you believe in<br/>
<br/>
Out of the obvious six billions, 365 dates<br/>
I produce, look after and nurture<br/>
That one little piece<br/>
<br/>
We want money, they say, never-ending economy<br/>
Recession, foreign exchange likely to fluctuate in harmony all around the world<br/>
<br/>
With 3 x as much money to buy out this planet, still not satisfied<br/>
Hey aliens!  Come collect that god damn money!<br/>
<br/>
Can somebody speak out?  That smiling face of yours<br/>
Was born from somebody's grief and blooms in somebody's desperation<br/>
<br/>
Shoved away to the corner of the universe, this nameless party<br/>
No choice but to proclaim oneself as the weak ones<br/>
<br/>
Out of the correct six billions, 365 wars<br/>
I protect, grow and check the right answer I only know<br/>
<br/>
Out of the obvious six billions, of 365 dates<br/>
I produce, look after and nurture<br/>

<dd>More than you wish, I'm all yours<br/>
Cut me up anyway you like<br/>
And take my blood too, one-time offer<br/>
<br/>
Teardrops from the eyes are too good to shed<br/>
Save it in a glass, don't let it be a waste<br/>
I want to drink it all up<br/>
<br/>
Locked are the tears that are full of all things that make us human<br/>
<br/>
If you touch it will break<br/>
If you don't touch it will collapse<br/>
I'll watch over you here and sing<br/>
To keep a legacy of our great history alive<br/>
<br/>
Words from your mouth drip to the middlemost<br/>
I squirm and dodge so that it won't cut deep<br/>
<br/>
Despair, hope, awe, calmness, subtleties, pleasure<br/>
Heaven and hell even frenzy, all depends on you<br/>
<br/>
Today I will dance on the palm of your hand<br/>
Might as well, a perfect swing<br/>
<br/>
On the land I was blown off to stand I preach love neither too much nor too little<br/>
<br/>
If you touch it will break<br/>
If you don't touch it will collapse<br/>
I'll watch over you here and sing<br/>
To keep the theorems of the universe alive<br/>
<br/>
Hand-me-down kisses, worn-out “I love you”-s<br/>
You say you'll cherish and smile<br/>
Two lines on your cheek made me respond<br/>
<br/>
So I touched<br/>
Before it breaks<br/>
And held tight for a long time<br/>
<br/>
If you touch it will break<br/>
If you don't touch it will collapse<br/>
Still I reach<br/>
To pick up all the pieces, was that alright?<br/>
<br/>
I must touch now with this hand<br/>
Before it collapses<br/>
I want to touch you as a whole<br/>
Before you break or collapse, to grow and start<br/>
I sing</dd>

<dd>Coward me, can't sleep with strangers around<br/>
But in your arms I'm happy as a clam<br/>
Armor my heart with shell to survive<br/>
But look, how soft and weak it gets sometimes<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind if you kick me in my teeth and push me around<br/>
I'm a blood covered bashful gentleman who sings as if nothings's happened<br/>
How about a taste of Pure Land in this living world?<br/>
Time and space folded in two, together we go back and forth<br/>
<br/>
I hope your wish comes true even just a little<br/>
If not, it's OK I feel that way today<br/>
<br/>
It dropped from your hand, if I could enter…<br/>
No need to grieve tonight, what I need is<br/>
<br/>
You, right there!  Don't force your value to everyone anyone<br/>
Zero score is as good as perfect score<br/>
My heart hurts a little so stop asking me<br/>
So what? Say what? And what?<br/>
<br/>
How many crossed out names from my life can I recover till I die?<br/>
You know how the story goes<br/>
To get a perfect score in the test, remember about<br/>
One who gave you the biggest check mark to you<br/>
<br/>
I hope your wish comes true even just a little<br/>
If not, it's OK I feel that way today<br/>
<br/>
Your wish is like a night before school trip<br/>
Excited - in my dream I'm already there<br/>
<br/>
In a half-asleep unscrewed right brain<br/>
We go till where we can, till we wake up, please say yes<br/>
<br/>
In a losing sight you'll see, a little bit more to the right<br/>
Tangled in umbilical code,  you have arrived!<br/>
<br/>
I hope your wish comes true even just a little<br/>
If not, it's OK I feel that way today<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I won't ask what it was that slipped from your hand<br/>
No need to grieve over<br/>
<br/>
I hope your wish comes true even just a little<br/>
Might as well wish for the liveliest one<br/>
<br/>
Lively enough to survive unkind words or catastrophe<br/>
Lively enough to not give in, never die<br/>
Show it to me now</dd>

<dd>Bravely we give up yesterday's dream and laugh<br/>
I hereby vow, resolution for today before I go to sleep<br/>
<br/>
But at times we give today up for the sake of yesterday's dream<br/>
And build a platform for ourselves of future<br/>
<br/>
Sensitively we work our antennas to death again<br/>
Hate me, I'm used to it, you can't hide, it's a lie<br/>
<br/>
Even murderer and Prime Minister have skills to be loved<br/>
It's all around their DNAs,  moms seeing them off saying “Have a good day”<br/>
<br/>
Dream + Dream   Selfish<br/>
Dream + Love      Tenderness<br/>
Dream + Voice     Make it happen<br/>
Add all up and remember<br/>
<br/>
Non-stopping girls running boys he'll be there for all of you<br/>
Shout it out born it out yah whatever hungry<br/>
Blue yellow green purple dream scramble egg, vanilla frost<br/>
Running tears scars tissues and insanity as well<br/>
<br/>
Capably we represent voices of this earth today<br/>
Self-appointed, recommended, no question asked, unanimous party<br/>
<br/>
Drama and tragedy, all's an act by a sock puppet<br/>
Trumpet blowing suicide bombing, hand clapping and laughing<br/>
<br/>
But don't worry, I'm by myself now, all tamed<br/>
Don't you worry, our moms and dads are quite popular<br/>
<br/>
For every single day out of 4.6 billion years<br/>
They kept making love and thus we are here<br/>
<br/>
Dream + Feather　Will reach<br/>
Dream + Seed　Have died<br/>
Dream + Lie　Beaten<br/>
Add all up, you'll see<br/>
<br/>
Non-stopping girls running boys he'll be there for all of you<br/>
Shout it out born it out yah whatever hungry<br/>
Blue yellow green purple dream scramble egg, vanilla frost<br/>
Running tears scars tissues and insanity as well<br/>
<br/>
Don't stop the rain of destiny<br/>
Don't peel the scab of love<br/>
<br/>
Non-stopping girls running boys he'll be there for all of you<br/>
Shout it out born it out yah whatever hungry<br/>
Blue yellow green purple dream scramble egg, vanilla frost<br/>
Running tears scars tissues and insanity as well<br/>
<br/>
Life's not enough, haven't found it yet but I swear I won't give up<br/>
Vow not to be disposed, an immediate vow<br/>
<br/>
It's not enough, it's a crap, but it's too good I can't stop<br/>
Wish for such anonymous future, a bitter wish<br/>
<br/>
Sadness plus tenderness is peace<br/>
Peace plus pain is anger<br/>
Anger plus warmth is tears<br/>
Tears plus tears means nothing left<br/>
<br/>
Voice plus heart is words<br/>
Words plus love is immediate<br/>
Add all up divided by us<br/>
It's the world we live</dd>

<dd>I declare war against my own child<br/>
I know I'll be jealous, yea, I can already imagine<br/>
What a lucky little boy to be blood-related to you<br/>
Least acting like grown-up I lose my patience and cry<br/>
<br/>
Many questions to ask you, my boy, yet to be born<br/>
How was your mommy's tummy?  I've never been there<br/>
Must've been beautiful, 10 months and 10 days you travelled<br/>
So happy and frustrated cause you know things I don't know<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the new world<br/>
From the tummy of such a mighty little girl<br/>
For the rest of all my days when I say beautiful, you're beautiful<br/>
I'll be always talking about you or your mom, now hey<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the new world<br/>
From the tummy of such a mighty little girl<br/>
I can't find a better reason to live for I'm here for…<br/>
I'm not gonna say it, no I'll never, I'll just keep it in my arms<br/>
<br/>
He's my child, he can barely walk<br/>
But I can't lose this game, I'll play fair man-to-man<br/>
<br/>
No lullaby nor bedtime story<br/>
No fairy tale to read you boy<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you your mom's story before you came<br/>
It's a story that no one else told, it's my story<br/>
<br/>
She shattered things into pieces, stirred up troubles<br/>
Made my world twinkle with the blinding light<br/>
My days before I met her was a trailer of what to come<br/>
Your mom's game plan was to make everything her own<br/>
<br/>
I fell right into it, one day you'll understand<br/>
It was luck worth a lifetime packed to the full<br/>
At the right time and in the right way<br/>
It was used<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the new world<br/>
From the tummy of such a mighty little girl<br/>
For the rest of all my days when I say beautiful, you're beautiful<br/>
I'll be always talking about you or your mom, now hey<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the new world<br/>
From the tummy of such a mighty little girl<br/>
I can't find a better reason to live for I'm here for…<br/>
I'm not gonna say it, no I'll never, I'll just keep it in my arms<br/>
<br/>
She'll be always mine you better keep that in your mind<br/>
Exception will be never made in case of any kind<br/>

I kept that oath my very first but you're the one who broke that first<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me; I'll never say twice, I won't tell you much<br/>
So be strong not fist more deeper in you<br/>
I'll always love you but second to your mom, of course<br/>
I can't give it you<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you're in lack of some warmness<br/>
Or maybe some time you feel hopeless<br/>
There's nothing better to touch<br/>
I guarantee you that, little boy</dd>

<dd>When I told her I've never felt anything like this<br/>
She acted as she couldn't care less<br/>
We didn't meet until now, she says<br/>
So, she says, it's perfectly natural<br/>
<br/>
When I asked what she'll do if I die tomorrow<br/>
She responded without even looking at my eyes<br/>
How will I know unless it happens? she says<br/>
She looked a bit angry<br/>
<br/>
Somehow it made me happy<br/>
It made me laugh<br/>
<br/>
You are the first<br/>
My first time ever, the first and the last<br/>
Once in a lifetime, 24/7<br/>
There was nobody before or since<br/>
<br/>
When I told her I don't want ordinary life<br/>
She responded in her usual tone<br/>
I want to be your ordinary, she says<br/>
Wish it be like that one day<br/>
<br/>
Ending is the beginning, yes I know<br/>
I've always been that way<br/>
But ending this is wrong, I don't need another beginning<br/>
That's how I feel, here and now<br/>
<br/>
Over and over<br/> 
I'll write a song to remind me<br/>
<br/>
You are the first<br/>
My first time ever, the first and the last<br/>
Once in a lifetime, 24/7<br/>
There was nobody before or since<br/>
<br/>
Here we make a promise<br/>
Our first time ever, the first and the last<br/>
Once in a lifetime, right here right now<br/>
No more beginning until the end<br/>
<br/>
I've never felt anything like this, she says<br/>
That's perfectly natural, I say</dd>

<dd>Where did I learn this trick?<br/>
Hurting people a piece of cake<br/>
<br/>
No one taught me<br/>
I rather wanted to develop the opposite skill<br/>
<br/>
Was it my fault?  Was it my fault?<br/>
<br/>
In another word it's inherent<br/>
It can't be acquired<br/>
<br/>
Then in the same breath<br/>
I'm hoping I get away with murder again<br/>
<br/>
Tears in my eyes, what do you want from me?<br/>
I'm scared to see the color of it<br/>
<br/>
Please take out the needles of words<br/>
Please pull out the thorns of heart<br/>
Please pull them out<br/>
While I'm anesthetized by your love<br/>
<br/>
The more they hope for happiness<br/>
The more I hack<br/>
<br/>
At this stage of the game, for some reason<br/>
I'm feeling a bit sorry for myself<br/>
<br/>
Which me shall I be to comfort myself today?<br/>
“You're kind cause you noticed it”<br/>
<br/>
Good job!  Way to go!  A few more nice words<br/>
May keep me alive for another night after tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
Give them to me, give them to me<br/>
<br/>
Where are the tears?<br/>
Dried up and disappeared before making me smile<br/>
<br/>
Please take out the needles of words<br/>
Please pull out the thorns of heart<br/>
Let me bleed, let it come down<br/>
And paint the world red from above<br/>
<br/>
Let it shower you shower you shower you<br/>
<br/>
Wind which blew inside you<br/>
Seed which glowed inside you<br/>
Lu lu lu lu lu lu lu<br/>
These unspoken words - your<br/>
<br/>
Dream<br/>
<br/>
Please take out the needles of words<br/>
Please pull out the thorns of heart<br/>
Please pull them out<br/>
While I'm anesthetized by your love<br/>
<br/>
Please take out the needles of words<br/>
Please pull out the thorns of heart<br/>
If your prayer was unanswered<br/>
Keep it with you strong and deep<br/>
And let it be your glowing seed</dd>
