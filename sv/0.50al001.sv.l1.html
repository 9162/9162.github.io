Erik Engdahl: Dedogmatisation - my method in social sciences and psychology.</h1>
<a href="../../64/dedog/dedog1-sv.html"></a><i><a href="../../64/dedog/dedog1-sv.html">På
svenska</a>!</i>
<p>There are numerous theories in social sciences and psychology. In life
only trivialities (e.g. that we die within about 140 years) predictable.
A theory about life actions, which has any kind of predictive power, is
thus necessarily a theory not about life in general but about <i>stereotypical,
stiff-legged </i>and<i> non-flexible</i> modes of life. Life becomes non-flexible
as a consequence of having <i>internalised</i>  problems of life as
prejudices. A forthcoming appendix will give a description of the concept
of prejudice in accordance with my favourite conceptual apparatus.

</p><p>I claim that most of such theories are dogmatic in the sense that they
contain <i>hidden </i>assumptions of internalisations. They create confusion
between what is natural in life and which happens to be just statistically
<i>normal</i>,
i.e. <i>majority misunderstandings</i>. One of the consequences of such
hidden assumptions is that the theories are more or less harmful, sweep
under the carpet various forms of oppression, and serve ideologically as
a pretext to escape from acting harmless and/or constructively. An action
is harmless if other people out of this action cannot find pretexts to
escape from acting harmlessly. Often there is a resistance against acting
harmlessly and/or constructively as such actions tend to arouse memories
of traumatised mental pain.

</p><p>Theories about life actions (with some form of predictive power) are
<i>useless</i>
as guidance to <i>harmless </i>and/or<i> constructive</i> actions as they
just deal with non-flexible living. Harmless and/or constructive actions
originate from <i>original wisdom</i>, something that each one fully is
in possession of. It is nevertheless most often as an emergency solution
put into oblivion. The harmless and/or constructive use of dogmatic theories
is an intellectual exercises in dedogmatisation.

</p><p>It would be pointless to dissociate oneself from a theory that one has
come to dislike. It would namely most probably  reappear as a "ghost"
in one or another from in that people tend to continue to <i>unconsciously</i>
be adherent to the rejected theory and/or is <i>opposite</i>. The rightful
place for theories about life actions is in the <i>graveyard</i>, in loving
memory preserved. The route to the graveyard goes via <i>dedogmatisation</i>,
not by rejection.

</p><p>It is possible to formulate the dedogmatisation method in any conceptual
apparatus. This is achieved by dedogmatisation of the conceptual apparatus
that one wants to use instead. The only advantage of my own favourite conceptual
apparatus, named the Unconditional Thinking of Everything(UTE), is that
it is almost(<a name="almostback"></a><a href="#almost">*</a>) undogmatic
already from the beginning. Its determining disadvantage is that that it
is (partially) <i>new</i>. It can be put into retirement, which would be
an advantage, as soon as I have had time to use the dedogmatisation in
full scale on some commonly known theory about life actions or ideology,
e.g. liberalism, liberal conservatism or social democracy.

</p><p>(<a name="almost"></a><a href="#almostback">*</a>) Its only remaining
infant malady is that I still claim that I sometimes master the dedogmatisation
method.

</p><p>It is, of course, only negative to have this <i>totalitarian</i> infant
malady. I work consciously to eliminate this as well. It is unlikely that
I completely could master this task, but substantial progress along this
line ought to be possible, and some of it I may already have achieved.

</p><p>If I were to succeed succeed with the aforementioned task, I would be
good in using the method simultaneously as I never would claim that I master
it. (Here appears the obvious question <i>why</i> I then currently <i>claim</i>
that I sometimes master the method when I nevertheless
<i>know</i> that
this claim is an infant malady. The answer is that false modesty is not
in my mode - strictly speaking it would be dishonest to sweep this infant
malady under the carpet.)
