Utilizing breakthrough technology, this non-invasive treatment provides protein-rich growth factors to the scalp.  Both men and women can use BENEV GF Hair Care Complex to improve the health of the scalp and develop healthier, stronger hair follicles.

<div class="colorDesc">
              Hair coloring products are typically categorized  based on the length of time they effect the colored hair.               The two most common classifications are ‘semi-permanent’  and ‘permanent’.  
                Semi-permanent color is formulated to deposit color  in the hair shaft without lightening it and gives very little damage.
                Permanent hair color products and lighteners  contain both a developer and an alkalizing ingredient as part of their ammonia  or an ammonia substitute.  The purpose of  this is to raise the cuticle of the hair fiber so the tint can penetrate and  therefore cause damages on the hair. Damaged hair from color will be brittle  and dry, and the important components will be lost from the raised cuticles so the damage to the hair will be worse. It is  very important for a treatment to follow afterwards. Because hairs do not have  the ability to regenerate its condition, if the hair is left untreated, it will  spread around. Therefore you should keep in mind, that treatments that helps  the damage to recover is necessary as well as aftercares you do at home.

                        It is a revolutionary process that softens, shines, straightens and makes the hair healthy. It penetrates the hair repairing internal damage and coats the hair preventing further damage. The results are smooth, silky and straight hair. It is not a chemical that restructures the hair. It is a replenishing treatment that reconditions and protects the hair from water and heat damage while enhancing it's natural shine.  The Brazilian hair treatment is excellent on all types of chemically treated hair (bleached, highlights, colored, permed, relaxed or previously straightened. It is excellent for getting rid of curly, frizzy, damaged, unhealthy, dull, mistreated hair.  The Brazilian treatment is made up of "Keratin" a liquid form of hair. There are no harsh chemicals. The Brazilian treatment can be used on children (6 years and older), teens and adults (men and women). The Brazilian treatment DOES NOT use strong chemicals to open and close the hair cuticle in an effort to straighten it. It only coats the hair. It does not break the bonds of the hair shaft like straighteners do. Keratin is a natural substance that comprises approximately 88% of your hair.  Brazilian treatment is not permanent. It naturally fades out of the hair. The wave or curl will gradually come back in about 2 - 3 months. The hair will stay soft, shiny and healthy looking. The more you do the treatment the better condition the hair becomes. The treatment also makes the hair very manageable. It will require less blow drying time and results will be very good with a flat iron.<br/>

<p>It is the least costly and most popular of the extensions.  Fake hair is attached to your real hair using melted silicone.

<div class="subtitleBox">Ring</div>
<div class="textMenu">
<p>This extension process uses metal rings to attach  the extension hair to the actual hair. Using a pressure machine, the metal ring  is pressed onto the hair to keep hold. The time it takes to attach is very  short, however the metal rings might hurt your scalp when sleeping.</p>

<div class="subColumn">
<div class="subtitleBox">Thread braiding</div>
<div class="textMenu">
<p>With a thin thread, the fake hair is braided onto  the actual hair. That is why this proccess needs great skill and time. But with  this investment, the hair does not fall out easily and there is less pain and  stress to the scalp. Because it is braided, it is also easy to remove. </p>
